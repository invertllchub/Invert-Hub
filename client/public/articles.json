        "text": "A decade ago, the creative world was divided neatly. Designers designed, coders coded, and entrepreneurs ran the show. Each field had its territory and language. But in today’s world, these boundaries have melted into one vast, connected ecosystem. The result is a new species of professional — the hybrid creative."

The creative industries went remote, digital tools became extensions of our hands, and suddenly, being “just a designer” wasn’t enough. The ones who thrived were those who could code their own ideas, automate their marketing, build systems, and lead across disciplines."
