_**Assistant**_

I can see that your Next.js build is failing because it can't find several component files. The error shows that `ScreenText`, `NavBar`, and `Footer` components are missing. Let me first explore the project structure to understand what's happening.

Good, I can see there is a `components` directory. Let me check what's inside it and also look at the files that are trying to import these components.

Great! The components do exist in the `components` directory. Now let me check the files that are trying to import them to see what the issue is.


---

Read file: app/page.tsx

---

Read file: app/layout.tsx

---

Now I can see the issue! The problem is with the import paths. In the `layout.tsx` file, the imports are using `../../client/components/` which is incorrect. The components are in the same directory level as the `app` folder, so the correct path should be `../components/`.

Let me fix these import paths:

Perfect! Now let me run the build command to see if this fixes the issue:


---

```bash
npm run build
```

---

I've fixed the import path issues in your `app/layout.tsx` file. The problem was that the imports were using `../../client/components/` instead of the correct `../components/` path.

Here's what I changed:

**In `app/layout.tsx`:**
- Changed `import NavBar from "../../client/components/NavBar";` to `import NavBar from "../components/NavBar";`
- Changed `import Footer from "../../client/components/Footer";` to `import Footer from "../components/Footer";`

The `app/page.tsx` file already has the correct import path for `ScreenText` (`import ScreenText from "../components/ScreenText";`), so that one was fine.

These changes should resolve the build errors you were seeing. The components exist in the `components` directory, but the import paths in `layout.tsx` were pointing to the wrong location.

Would you like me to run the build command to verify that the issue is resolved, or would you prefer to test it yourself?

Same problem

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue is still persisting. It seems like the changes I made to the `layout.tsx` file might not have been applied correctly, or there might be a caching issue. Let me check the current state of the files and verify the import paths.


---

Read file: app/layout.tsx

---

Good, the `layout.tsx` file has the correct import paths now. Let me also check the `page.tsx` file to make sure it's correct:


---

Read file: app/page.tsx

---

The import paths look correct in both files. Let me verify that the component files actually exist and check their file extensions:


---

| 📄 `SideBarNav.tsx` |
| 📄 `Search-Icon.tsx` |
| 📄 `Footer.tsx` |
| 📄 `ScreenText.tsx` |

</details>

---

The components exist. Let me check if there might be an issue with the file extensions or if we need to explicitly specify the `.tsx` extension in the imports. Let me also check the `tsconfig.json` to see if there are any path mapping configurations:


---

Read file: tsconfig.json

---

I see there's a path mapping configuration with `@/*` pointing to `./*`. This means we can use absolute imports with the `@` prefix. Let me try updating the imports to use the absolute path mapping instead of relative paths:

Perfect! Now all the imports are using the correct absolute path mapping with `@/components/`. Let me also check if there are any other pages or files that might need to be updated. Let me check if there are any other pages in the app directory:


---

| 📁 `contact` |
| 📁 `about` |
| 📄 `page.module.css` |
| 📄 `globals.css` |
| 📄 `favicon.ico` |

</details>

---

Let me check the about and contact directories to see if they also have pages that might be importing these components:


---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/about • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |

</details>

---

Let me check if these pages also import any of the components:

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "import.*components" • **0** files</summary>

---

</details>

---

Great! It looks like only the main `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` files were importing these components, and I've already fixed those. 

Now let me try to run a build to see if the issue is resolved:


---

```bash
npm run build
```

---

I've updated the import paths in both `app/layout.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` to use the absolute path mapping with `@/components/` instead of relative paths. This should resolve the module resolution issues.

Here's what I changed:

**In `app/layout.tsx`:**
- Changed `import NavBar from "../components/NavBar";` to `import NavBar from "@/components/NavBar";`
- Changed `import Footer from "../components/Footer";` to `import Footer from "@/components/Footer";`

**In `app/page.tsx`:**
- Changed `import ScreenText from "../components/ScreenText";` to `import ScreenText from "@/components/ScreenText";`

The `@/` prefix is configured in your `tsconfig.json` to map to the root directory, which should make the imports more reliable and consistent.

Would you like me to run the build command to verify that the issue is resolved, or would you prefer to test it yourself? The changes should fix the "Module not found" errors you were seeing.
